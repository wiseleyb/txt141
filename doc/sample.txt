For all <strong>that</strong> are fatigued from colleagues belching symptoms of seasonal affective disorder, then retire from the wet-worn title of weathered grommet to the refreshing title of postholer at Crystal.  Should be good all week.  

See ya on the slopes, in the air, or both.  I will probably be there through the weekend starting this AM.  Deepest postholer gets refreshments... lets just say standing positions recommended...though burying a couple of suffering pilot's hot heads will make a better photo-op.

I should feel spunky tomorrow night and will be happy to <a href="http://cnn.com">play patty-cake</a> with any lovely lady... being polite I'll leave the laddy to El Diablo.  

Sleep isn't much of an option for me tonight (work) so phone calls are welcome http://reddit.com anytime as I prepare... I expect to be staying at Crystal tomorrow night, and perhaps days longer (hopefully lodge prices are cheap during the week).   

As of 4am, 3 pilots are heading out.  Skiers and Boarders.  Acro/XC/Tandem wings.

Just got home... 3 hrs to dust off the toys then find fresh powder with Gordon and Trish.  You need a current USHPA card with a "3" to fly (or be tandem passenger).  As of last year, postholing was an acceptable and entertaining launch technique, so I didn't lug my board up when flying.
