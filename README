txt141 is a simple text shortener that I was hoping to integrate with apps like TweetDeck.  Unfortunately once I finished it TweetDeck came out with their own version of this app.  So, I'm open sourcing it for anyone interested.

Basis:
* Rails 3
* Redis for data storage (there is no sql db)
* Twitter OAuth integration

Feel free to ask any question: wiseleyb@gmail.com

This is currently running on heroku if you want to check it out:  http://txt141.heroku.com


Used to deploy with:
* Moonshine for deployment http://blog.railsmachine.com/articles/2010/02/17/smooth-devoperations-deploying-rails-3-with-moonshine/

To re-enable 
* copy pre-heroku/manifests to app/manifests
* copy per-herokuy/moonshine to vendor/plugins/moonshine
* uncomment capistrano and shadowpuppet in the Gemfile
* add something in config/initializers/constants.rb to handle redis in production
