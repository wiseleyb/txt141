txt141 is a simple text shortener that I was hoping to integrate with apps like TweetDeck.  Unfortunately once I finished it TweetDeck came out with their own version of this app.  So, I'm open sourcing it for anyone interested.

Basis:
* Rails 3
* Moonshine for deployment http://blog.railsmachine.com/articles/2010/02/17/smooth-devoperations-deploying-rails-3-with-moonshine/
* Redis for data storage (there is no sql db)
* Twitter OAuth integration

Feel free to ask any question: wiseleyb@gmail.com
